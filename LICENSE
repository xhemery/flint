Cisco Sample Code
License, Examples and Project Templates to enable Cisco resources to produce and share Cisco Sample Code

Cisco Sample Code License
This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

License: For all Sample Code postings*, you must include a copy of the Cisco Sample Code License in a LICENSE text file in the root of the repository.

Header: You must include the Cisco copyright and license notice HEADER in every source code file (see the examples folder for language specific examples of how this should be done).

Note: For single-file code sharing (like a GitHub GIST, e-mail, blog, message or post), including the header in the source code is sufficient (you do not have to include the full license text).

Examples
To make getting started as simple as possible, we have provided some language and use-case specific examples.

Docs
We have also provided examples for some common project docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, etc.).
